# Algorithms in Logistics : the KnapSack Problem

## Context and introduction 
The knapSack problem is a very famous problem of combinatorial optimization as it is one of the 21 NP-complete problems presented by Richard Karp in 1971 . 

It appears in many situation in transport and logistic and can be illustrated by the following example : 

A logistic company wants to optmize its shipments. To do so, it has to choose among 
several items, each having their own value and volume, a subset of items fitiing in 
the cargo truck while having the maximal sum of values.

To give a concrete example, *what would be the optimal subset for the following group of items if the maximal capacity of the cargo trick is 15 L?*

| id                | A | B | C | D  | E  | F | G  |
|-------------------|---|---|---|----|----|---|----|
| values (in euros) | 7 | 9 | 5 | 12 | 14 | 6 | 12 |
| volumes (in L)     | 3 | 4 | 2 | 6  | 7  | 3 | 5  |

## First approach 

The first approach I had has been to quantify how profitable each items were. Intuitively, it is easy to say that the item F is more profitable than the item A
as it has more value for the same volume. Therefore, the quantifier I used was the ratio **value/volume** so I sorted the items from the higher ratio to the lowest.

| id            | C   | G   | A   | B    | D | E | F |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|------|---|---|---|
| ratio   (â‚¬/L) | 2.5 | 2.4 | 2.3 | 2.25 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

Once sorted, I only had to add the first volumes until there was no room left for a new vitem's volume in the imaginary cargo.
This is when I noticed a limit of this method or at least for its implementation. Indeed, after summing the volumes of the items C,G,A and B,
I ended up with a __total volume of 14L and a total value of 33 euros__. But if I had swapt the items C and F, I would have ended up with a __total volume of 15L and a 
total value of 34 euros__. 
It was obvious that the algorithm was not capable of giving the optimal solution. 

## Complexity Analysis 
### Greedy algorithm resolution 
This first intuition is indeed close to the greedy algorithm's resolution of this problem which makes locally optimal solution. 
Therefore, it is higly dependent of the volumes' value and if their sum is equal to the cargo truck capacity. 

Moreover, to implement this algorithm, I have to sort the ratio's array in a first time. 
I used to python's built-in function "sorted" of temporal complexity equal to O(nlog(n)), where n is the number of items.
Then in the second part, in the worst case scenario a loop goes over all the items which correspond to a O(n) complexity. 
Therefore, the **temporal complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog(n))**. 
Regarding the spatial complexity, only an array of length n needs to be created in order to keep track of the ratios. 
Thus, the **spatial complexity of the algorithm is O(n)**. 

To have a reliable solution to this problem, the greedy algorithm resolution is not satisfying as it can not guarantee to give the optimal result. I have still decided to
implement it in order to compare its results with the dynamic programming'ones.  

### Dynamic Programming resolution

To explain the second method used, let's get back to the definition of the dynamic programming. The principle of this method is to break down a problem in several sub-problems. Then, solving the problem will is equivalent to get the resolution of the sub-problems it is composed of. The resolution of the sub-problems are stored in 
memory in order to access them easily, without recomputing them every times. 
In our case, this method is applied as following : let's consider a cargo truck of capacity C and a list of items of length N. Finding the optimal subset for the combinaison
(N,C) is similar to find get the subset for the combinaison (N-1,C) and see if any of the remaining items could fit in the cargo truck. If so, the item will be added to the 
optimal subset and the total value of the shipment will be increased by the item's value. If the item does not fit, the optimal subset fo (N,C) is the same than (N-1,C). 

Because we have to loop over all the N items for each capacity between 1 and C, the **temporal complexity of the algorithm is O(NC)**. To store all the sub maximum, we need to construct a N-by-C matrix as explained above so the **spatial complexity of the algorithm is O(NC)**. 
There is no need to compre both methods'complexities as the Dynamix Programming resolution offers an optimal subset whereas the greedy algorithm is only able to compute a locally optimal solution. 

## Implementation 

PSeudo code for the greedy algorithm :

> Sort the volumes and the values from the highest ratio value/volume per item to the lowest. 

> sum_volume,sum_value = 0,0 

> // Make sure that the next item will fit before adding it 

> While sum_volume + next_item_volume <= total_capacity

  >> sum_volume += next_item_volume 
  
  >> sum_value += next_item_value 
  
  >> increase next_item
  
  >> add current item to the subset 
  
> return subset,sum_value,sum_volume
